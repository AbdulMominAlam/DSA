# Evaluating the Effect of Economic Conditions on Corporate R&D Investments

1. Project Proposal: 
Corporate spending on research and development is essential for driving innovation and staying ahead in the market. However, factors like economic growth,
inflation, and unemployment can have a major impact on how companies decide to allocate their resources, including their R&D budgets. This project will explore
how these broader economic conditions influence R&D investments across various industries and countries.



Data Sources:
A. OECD Research and Development Expenditure Dataset (Main R&D Data Source):

Dataset Name: "OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators (MSTI)"

Source: OECD.STAT - MSTI Database

Coverage: R&D expenditures by country, sector (e.g., business, government), and industry.

Frequency: Annual

Time Period: I will use data from 2010 to 2023 to reflect recent economic trends.

B. Macroeconomic Indicators (Economic Conditions Data):

GDP Growth, Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate

Primary Source: World Bank Open Data (data.worldbank.org)

Time Period: 2010 to 2023 (aligned with R&D data)

C. Company-Level Financial and R&D Data:

Dataset Name: “Compustat North America Fundamentals Annual” or Kaggle dataset such as “Top Companies R&D Spend (Global)”

Coverage: Financial metrics (e.g., revenue, net income) and R&D expenditures of major corporations.

Industries: Focus on tech, chemical, and manufacturing sectors.

Time Period: 2010 to 2023

3. Data Collection Plan:
   - R&D Investment Data: 
   - I will download R&D expenditure data from the OECD dataset and financial reports of companies.
   
   - Macroeconomic Data:
   - I will gather economic data from Kaggle datasets or trusted sources like the World Bank, focusing on GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates. Basically all economic indicators
     related to my proposal.

   - Data Alignment:
   - Take datasets from a similar timeline ie the same finiancial year, quarter etc.
