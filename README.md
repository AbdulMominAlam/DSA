Evaluating the Effect of Economic Conditions on Corporate R&D Investments

Objective
Corporate investment in research and development (R&D) plays a crucial role in driving innovation, productivity, and long-term economic growth. However, such investment decisions are influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions, including GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, and government support. This project will explore how these economic factors impact R&D spending across different countries and over time.

Planned Data Collection & Preparation
To conduct this analysis, I will combine data from reputable public sources using a structured and reproducible approach. With the assistance of ChatGPT, I will gather and align data from the following sources:
OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators


Dataset: Main Science and Technology Indicators (MSTI)


Data Points: R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP, Government’s share of R&D funding


Coverage: Country-level, annual data (2010–2023)


World Bank Open Data


Indicators: GDP Growth (%), Inflation (%), Unemployment Rate (%)


Description: Core macroeconomic variables to evaluate economic conditions


Time Frame: 2010–2023


Export and Innovation Data


Source: World Bank and relevant OECD indicators


Variable: High-tech exports as a percentage of manufactured exports


Purpose: To represent industrial innovation output


Using ChatGPT and Python (Pandas), I will clean, preprocess, and merge these datasets on the basis of Country and Year to create a single panel dataset. This merged dataset will serve as the foundation for both exploratory and predictive analysis.

Countries to Be Included
I plan to include 10 countries representing diverse economic and innovation profiles:
 Germany, South Korea, Japan, United States, United Kingdom, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey.

Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 I will use statistical summaries and visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, time-series plots, boxplots) to understand how R&D investment correlates with macroeconomic indicators.


Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 PCA will be used to reduce dimensionality and uncover key drivers of variance across countries’ innovation environments.


Hypothesis Testing
 I will develop and test several hypotheses, such as:


Higher GDP growth correlates with higher R&D spending


Inflation and unemployment negatively impact R&D investment


Government support enhances innovation outcomes


Machine Learning Modeling
 I will train and evaluate a range of models to predict R&D spending using macroeconomic inputs


Linear Regression


Decision Tree


Random Forest


XGBoost


k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
 I will also apply K-Means Clustering to identify groups of countries with similar innovation characteristics.



Tools to Be Used
I plan to use Google Colab for coding, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and modeling, and ChatGPT to support data alignment, code debugging, and result interpretation.

Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, I aim to:
Identify which economic factors are most strongly associated with national R&D investment


Validate economic hypotheses using real-world data


Develop machine learning models to predict R&D intensity based on macroeconomic indicators


Classify countries into innovation clusters based on their economic and R&D profiles
