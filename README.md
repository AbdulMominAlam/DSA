# Evaluating the Effect of Economic Conditions on Corporate R&D Investments

1. Project Proposal: 
Corporate spending on research and development is essential for driving innovation and staying ahead in the market. However, factors like economic growth,
inflation, and unemployment can have a major impact on how companies decide to allocate their resources, including their R&D budgets. This project will explore
how these broader economic conditions influence R&D investments across various industries and countries.



2. Data Sources:
A. OECD Research and Development Expenditure Dataset: 
   - Provides R&D expenditure data across countries and industries.
   
B. Economic Indicators: 
   - Data on GDP growth, inflation rates, and unemployment, which can be sourced from Kaggle datasets or public data repositories like the World Bank.
   
C. Company Financial Data:
   - Includes data on company performance, R&D investments, and financial metrics, which can be sourced from Kaggle or other financial databases.



3. Data Collection Plan:
   - R&D Investment Data: 
   - I will download R&D expenditure data from the OECD dataset and financial reports of companies.
   
   - Macroeconomic Data:
   - I will gather economic data from Kaggle datasets or trusted sources like the World Bank, focusing on GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates. Basically all economic indicators
     related to my proposal.

   - Data Alignment:
   - Take datasets from a similar timeline ie the same finiancial year, quarter etc.
